#Theoretical Areas of Interest

Enquiry into the production and consumption of images in the 21st century is a dauntingly huge challenge. My process over the next few months will be to narrow my areas of interest to a manageable number of subjects suitable for the production of new work. Here is the current list of ideas and approaches. 

##There Is Only Software

To quote Lev Manovich:

> Depending on the software I am using, the “properties” of a media object can change dramatically. Exactly the same file with the same contents can take on a variety of identities depending on the software being used. What does this finding means in relation to the persisting primacy of the term “digital” in understanding new media? Let me answer this as clear and direct as I can. There is no such thing as “digital media.” There is only software – as applied to media data (or “content”).

##Data Portraiture

Lots of things come under this, from Google, Facebook, etc generating profiles to Fitbit health data to DNA reconstructions and so on. The connection to photography is perhaps tenuous, but the connection to portrature is fascinating. Is there a "painting > photography > data" line? Can a data portrait be "composed"? How might a data artist approach portraiture?
