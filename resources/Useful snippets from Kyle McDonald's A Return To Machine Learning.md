##Useful snippets from Kyle McDonald's [A Return To Machine Learning](https://medium.com/@kcimc/a-return-to-machine-learning-2de3728558eb#.946h1zjp9)

For anyone interested in making similar visualizations with t-SNE (and word2vec) I’ve compiled a collection “Embedding Scripts” on [GitHub](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/EmbeddingScripts), developed during [a residency at ITP](http://itp.nyu.edu). But since initially working on this, I’ve found some simpler ways to accomplish the same thing, and would suggest instead looking at some of the examples like [word2vec](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ml-examples/blob/master/workshop/word2vec/word2vec.ipynb) and [lda_tsne](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ml-examples/blob/master/workshop/lda_tsne/LDA%20and%20t-SNE.ipynb) from [this workshop with Yusuke Tomoto](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ml-examples/tree/master/workshop) (hosted by [Rhizomatiks](http://rhizomatiks.com)). If you’re interested in real-time, interactive visualizations that use the colored-[Voronoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) layout above, try [this openFrameworks example](https://github.com/yusuketomoto/ml-examples-oF/blob/master/tSNEPlot/src/main.cpp) from the same workshop.
