#Notes and works in progress towards my new body of work for 2017

In late 2017 I will be presenting a new body of work as the culmination of a three year fellowship at [Birmingham Open Media](http://bom.org.uk). Over the next year I will be preparing for and creating this work. I will be using this repository to collect, process and refine my ideas and approaches. You are welcome to peruse, share and collaborate with me if you feel the need or desire. 

No pages here are complete (unless otherwise stated). 

My email is pete@peteashton.com and I'm on Twitter at [@peteashton](http://twitter.com/peteashton)
