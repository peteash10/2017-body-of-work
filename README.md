#Notes and works in progress towards my new body of work for 2017

In late 2017 I will be presenting a new body of work as the culmination of a three year fellowship at [Birmingham Open Media](http://bom.org.uk). Over the next year I will be preparing for and creating this work. I will be using this repository to collect, process and refine my ideas and approaches. You are welcome to peruse, share and collaborate with me if you feel the need or desire. 

No pages here are complete (unless otherwise stated). There will be typos. 

My email is pete@peteashton.com and I'm on Twitter at [@peteashton](http://twitter.com/peteashton)

##Contents

I'm attempting to boil everything down into a series of documents. These will be expanded, edited down, merged and split until I'm happy with them. Here's the current batch. 

1.	[Opening Statement](https://github.com/peteash10/2017-body-of-work/blob/master/1%20-%20Opening%20Statement.md) - Aiming to have this down to three paragraphs. Will take a while to get there!
2.	[Practical Areas of Interest](https://github.com/peteash10/2017-body-of-work/blob/master/2%20-%20Practical%20Areas%20of%20Interest.md) - The tools, methods and techniques I'm looking to use. 
3.	[Theoretical Areas of Interest](https://github.com/peteash10/2017-body-of-work/blob/master/3%20-%20Theoretical%20Areas%20of%20Interest.md) - The ideas, theories and concepts I'm looking to explore with those tools. 

##Why GitHub?

Since deleting my (15 year old!) blog and returning [peteashton.com](http://peteashton.com) to a collection of basic HTML documents I've been looking for the right format to work online with. Blogging was great because it allowed me to process my thoughts in public, but the time-stamped stream does not lend itself to iteration. I need something that allows for editing and processing of single pieces, not a journal. 

I looked at Wikis but the available options were either too small or too supermassive and didn't feel comfortable. I also wanted to avoid maintaining software on a server as my tolerance for system administration is at an all time low. I want to write, not manage a website. 

I am trying to wean myself off Google's services, so using their Docs is not preferable. I also have an aversion to venture-capital funded, commercial publishing platforms like Medium, but that also suffers from the "publish and forget" blogging thing. 

I'd started to use GitHub to dump what passes for my code and once I understood the concepts ([these videos are excellent](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV)) got quite interested in it as a platform for working on things-that-aren't-code. I like that [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is rendered automatically, because Markdown is great for Just Writing Stuff and not worrying about how it'll look. And I was really inspired by how Golan Levin uses it for his teaching materials, specifically for the [Experimental Capture](https://github.com/golanlevin/ExperimentalCapture) workshop I attended. 

GitHub uses [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)) which is a form of version control. This means that many people can contribute to a project, writing and editing stuff, without it all getting fucked up. I'm not necessarily interested in collaborating here, but the fact that every significant edit I make is recorded is interesting and useful. I also like that it's all out in the open, warts and all. 

Yes, GitHub is a private company that has taken VC money, but it doesn't feel as politically nebulous and utopian as the likes of Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc. It's just a tool used by programmers to make code, and it makes it money by charging them for features. And the nature of Git means all the files are also on my computer. 

My next year of work is one large project resulting in an exhibition. Using what is effectively a project management tool to work on it in public makes perfect sense to me.
