# Notes and works in progress towards my new body of work for 2017

In late 2017 I will be exhibiting a new body of work at [Birmingham Open Media](http://bom.org.uk). Between now and then I will be preparing for and creating this work. I will be using this repository to collect, process and refine my ideas and approaches. You are welcome to peruse, share and collaborate with me if you feel the need or desire. 

No pages here are complete (unless otherwise stated). There will be typos. 

My email is pete@peteashton.com and I'm on Twitter at [@peteashton](http://twitter.com/peteashton). My art website is [art.peteashton.com](http://art.peteashton.com)
