#Notes and works in progress towards my new body of work for 2017

In late 2017 I will be presenting a new body of work as the culmination of a three year fellowship at [Birmingham Open Media](http://bom.org.uk). Over the next year I will be preparing for and creating this work. I will be using this repository to collect, process and refine my ideas and approaches. You are welcome to peruse, share and collaborate with me if you feel the need or desire. 

No pages here are complete (unless otherwise stated). There will be typos. 

My email is pete@peteashton.com and I'm on Twitter at [@peteashton](http://twitter.com/peteashton)

##Contents

I'm attempting to boil everything down into a series of documents. These will be expanded, reduced, merged and split between whenever now is and the end of October 2016. Here's the current batch. 

1.	[Opening Statement](https://github.com/peteash10/2017-body-of-work/blob/master/1%20-%20Opening%20Statement.md) - Aiming to have this down to three paragraphs. Will take a while to get there!
2.	[Practical Areas of Interest](https://github.com/peteash10/2017-body-of-work/blob/master/2%20-%20Practical%20Areas%20of%20Interest.md) - The tools, methods and techniques I'm looking to use. 
3.	[Theoretical Areas of Interest](https://github.com/peteash10/2017-body-of-work/blob/master/3%20-%20Theoretical%20Areas%20of%20Interest.md) - The ideas, theories and concepts I'm looking to explore with those tools. 
4. [Sociopolitical Areas of Interest](https://github.com/peteash10/2017-body-of-work/blob/master/4%20-%20Sociopolitical%20Areas%20of%20Interest.md) - Making it matter. The issues I'd like to explore and highlight with my work.
5. [Inspirational Works](https://github.com/peteash10/2017-body-of-work/blob/master/5%20-%20Inspirational%20Works.md) - A small selection of pieces I admire. 
6. [Potential Collaborators](https://github.com/peteash10/2017-body-of-work/blob/master/6%20-%20Potential%20Collaborators.md) - People and entities I'd like to work with.
