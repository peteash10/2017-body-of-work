#Inspirational Works

A small selection of works by others which have helped inform and inspire my practice.

>Only six weeks after the tragic 2005 subway bombings in London, New York's Metro Transit Authority (MTA) signed a contract with the high-tech defense and military technology giant Lockheed Martin for the promise of a high-tech surveillance system driven by computer vision and artificial intelligence. The security system failed miserably and the contract collapsed under lawsuits. As a result, thousands of security cameras in the New York subway stations sit unused and the public is kept safe through old fashion methods of law enforcement.

>The Depth Editor Debug series imagines what the world would have looked like through the eyes of that system. 

##[Alfons Schilling's Vision Machines](http://www.alfonsschilling.net/werke/sehmaschinen/)

Schilling was an Austrian artist who did pioneering work in VR and perception art. All his work is of interest but I'm particularly fascinated by his vision-altering contraptions. Often bulky and awkward, they restrict the vision of the wearer and change how they perceive the world. 

I would like to build something similar which simulates how different cameras and capture devices "see the world". For example, as a [rolling-shutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_shutter) or a [slit-scan](http://flong.com/texts/lists/slit_scan/).
