[SoundNet](http://prostheticknowledge.tumblr.com/post/154123790536/soundnet-computer-science-research-from-mit-csail) - Computer Science research from MIT CSAIL can recognize the content of video based on audio using neural networks.

[Invisible Cities](https://opendot.github.io/ml4a-invisible-cities/) - In this project, we trained a neural network to translate map tiles into generative satellite images. We trained individual models for several cities–Milan, Venice, and Los Angeles–allowing us to do city map style transfer (example above) by applying the aerial model of one city onto the map tiles of another. Also, we can create imaginary cities by hand-drawing sketches and feeding them to the generative model.
