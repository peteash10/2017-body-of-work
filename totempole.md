#Totem Pole specifications

The Totem Pole is a column approximately 5 metres high and around 1 metre in diameter. 

It will stand in the middle of the Gallery at Birmingham Open Media for three months during my exhibition, roughly where the table is in this photo.

Around the bottom of the pole will be a "praying area" with cushions to kneel on. 

The column will be covered in polygons cut from wood small enough to fit on the Fizzpop laser cutter. At least six of them will frame 4:3 LCD monitors (in a manner which looks as unlike 4:3 LCD monitors as possible). The rest will be etched with slogans and symbols. 

At the rear of the column the low-poly shapes will continue along the floor and spread up the corner wall where shelves form a shrine containing tributes. 

**Low Poly example.** I really like the round but uneven body of this elk.
