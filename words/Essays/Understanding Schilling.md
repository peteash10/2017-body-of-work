# Understanding Schilling

*Pete Ashton, 2015-12-30*


In early October, during the first [Goodbye Wittgenstein](http://art.peteashton.com/art/goodbye-wittgenstein/) exchange, I was introduced to [Alfons Schilling](http://www.alfonsschilling.net) by Thomas Philipp aka Fipps of the Austrian [qujOchÖ](http://qujochoe.org/) collective, after I told him about my adventures in [building cameras](http://bhamobscura.com) and what I’ve come to call “active seeing”, aka methods for paying attention to what’s around you. A quick image search turned up this picture.

Which is a man with some kind of contraption on his head. I liked this image a lot. 

So who is this man and why is he building these marvellous things? Obviously they’re awesome in and of themselves, but what’s the underlying idea? Where is the Art?

I think Alfons Schilling is going to be the most important practical reference point for my work this year. (My theoretical reference point is still [Vilém Flusser](http://peteashton.com/art/2828/)) so I’m going to try and spend a few blog posts outlining and understanding what he’s doing when he makes these things. This is the first attempt.

Unfortunately, while Schilling seems fairly well known in Austrian art circles there’s not so much written in English, and my German is non-existent. Also, [the one book about his work](http://amzn.to/1PxRkMl) is currently £125 on Amazon, which is sightly out of my budget, and doesn’t appear to be in Birmingham library catalogues. But have found one good survey of his work in English by [Martina Tritthart](http://www.spacelab.at/bio/). It’s a password-protected PDF which can’t be copied or printed, but you can read it. [I’ve uploaded it here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rv8uqyi7604g5hu/3D%20binocular%20vision%20in%20the%20work%20of%20Alfons%20Schilling%20-%20Martina%20Tritthart.pdf?dl=0) and will now work through it in a blog post, as is my way.

Tritthart starts with a really useful observation.

*   The participation of the observer is the key to [Schilling’s] artwork. The activities of the observer in fact constitute the artwork. The perceiver becomes the producer through perception.

This is something I’ve often wanted through my work and the idea of the “art” emerging as the viewer processes the piece is very attractive.

After a couple of pages on historical precedents for thinking about space and vision, Tritthart begins to describe Schilling’s work. Some excerpts:

*   Schilling has engaged intensively with binocular perception and the possible ways of representing space and movement in pictures.
*   [He] invites the recipient to become conscious of his perception and his faculty for knowledge.
*   Schilling looks at consciousness and cognitive reactions to the environment.
*   Schilling dealt with the mechanisms of perception themselves.
*   [He] constructs experimental compositions […] in which viewers are forced into active participation. The work does not demand objective viewing, but exists only in the subjective experience of the recipient.

She then describes some of his works, which you can read for yourself, before making some final statements.

*   Schilling demonstrates that the physical equipment used in the process of perception determines the perception of space, and that visual perception is therefore overrated. [Deliciously definitive statement there which raises all the eyebrows!]
*   His work […] evokes questions in the viewer about himself and his perception, space and infinity.
*   He calls into question the mechanisms of perception in the brain that construct the interpretation of reality.

Finally, this nutshell:

*   [His] strategy of disconcerting the viewer makes the later aware of his role as perceiver and knower.

Making the viewer aware of what they’re doing when they experience at artwork seems a very worthwhile thing to do.

There’s plenty there that I can use to start to build my own framework for exploring potential and speculative cameras. Thanks to Martina Tritthart for explaining his work so well, and for putting it online for me to read.

If you know of any other good resources on Schilling, preferably in English, please do let me know!
