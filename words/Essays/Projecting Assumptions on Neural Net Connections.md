#Projecting Assumptions on Neural Net Connections

I've been playing with t-SNE grouping of images recently and it's been quite interesting (which is a relief as it's a real pain setting these things up when you don't know what you're doing!)

The process is relatively simple. Over on a big computer somewhere, someone shows an algorithm thousands of photographs with descriptions of what's in those photographs. Over time the algorithm "learns" what certain things look like based on similarities in the shapes and contexts. Eventually, having seen a few hundreds photos of a dog, you can show it a new photo of a dog that it's never seen before and there's a good chance it'll say "dog". 

If you've ever read a picture book with a toddler you'll know what I'm talking about. 

The result of this learning can be packaged up in a relatively small dataset (usually around a gigabyte of data) and can be queried on a standard consumer computer (like my MacBook) to recognise images, or at least attempt to. If the algorithm never saw any pictures of, say, horses it's not going to recognise them, but it will do it's best. (I tried this in my garden once and it labled my rabbit as a cow, which was amusing.) 

The jargon for this sort of thing includes terms like "neural networks" and "artificial intelligence" which is a bit misleading as, while there are similarities, they don't work like the networks of neurons in your brain and they don't produce anything that we could usefully call intelligence. That might have been the goal originally but my understanding is it's more useful for programmers to move away from trying to mimic human minds. 

So the computer isn't thinking. It's not learning. But it is sorting and categorising with a level of complexity that we can be fooled into thinking it is thinking. Just as some fatalists say we're living in a deterministic universe where everthing is predestined, it's just so absurdly complex it might as well be free will, these algorithms are so complex it's easier for the layperson to just call it intelligence and be done with it.
