#Photography in the (second decade of the) 21st Century

It's November 2016 and as the world rapidly turns to shit I find it hard to think clearly about photography, the technology, artform and medium that has dominated my life for the last decade. The making of images feels both insignificant on the one hand and vastly significant on the other, so much so that opining about it seems as pointless as tilting at windmills or screaming at the gods. 

So in an attempt to find meaning in my art practice I'm going to use this exercise to document what I know, think and feel about photography today, and to attempt to extend it beyond the mere creation of images to something more meaningful. 

##Photography as a metaphor for society

This is my ultimate goal, to develop an understanding of cameras and photography which sheds light on our society. 

##The Fallacy of Digital Photography

The digital camera is not a device for making photographs. It is a device for capturing light data from the world in front of it. This data is turned into what we consider "photographs" in a separate process undertaken by the computer embedded in the camera. 

The analogue negative is a strip of light sensitive film which records [radiometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiometry) data in a visually realised manner. The digital negative is a computer file storing this data non-visually. On its own the digital negative means nothing. It need software to make sense of it. 

This software makes a transformation. It takes radiometric data (the measure of electromagnetic radiation in space) and converts it to [photometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photometry_(optics)) data (how light is perceived by the human eye) to create photographs that look "right" to us. *As a sidebar, navigating the difference between what the camera records and what we expect to see is part of the photographer's skill-set.* 

The film camera is a device which makes images. The digital camera is a device which stores raw data which *can* be converted into visual images, or can be used for something else. This distinction is important. 

All "digital" processes can be thought of in these terms. Simply put, an analogue process renders signals from the world immediately, like the needle vibrating on a way cylinder. A digital process stores those signals as numbers to be rendered later, if at all. 

##Image processing is just mathematics

To be fair, everything you do on a computer is mathematics, and some would argue the universe is run on mathematics, but there's something quietly illuminating about how photo processing depends on some quite basic maths. 

The best way to understand the mathematics of images is to learn a bit of [Processing](https://processing.org). Processing is a fairly simple programming language used mostly by artists. Alongside many many things, it can be used to dissect digital images. It does this using maths. 

([This is a good intro](https://processing.org/tutorials/pixels/) to how Processing works with images. I strongly recommend [Daniel Shiffman's videos on Processing](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YB9x6f23CBftiyx0u_5sO9) for a good understanding of what's going on even if you're not interested in coding yourself.) 

A digital image is a grid of dots. Each of those dots, or pixels, has a number value which references its colour. The computer builds this array of colours which, when seen on a screen or printed on paper, looks like an image to our eyes. 

Processing an image involves taking the value of each pixel, comparing it with the values of nearby pixels and applying some mathematical algorithm. To brighten a digital image you don't turn up the lights - you increase the numbers. The effect is the same but the process is very different. 

I'm not sure how important this is, but it feels important as a piece of foundational knowledge. 

##Photographs are abstractions from reality
