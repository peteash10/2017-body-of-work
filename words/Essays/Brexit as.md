Brexit as Art

When you put a piece of art into the world you lose control of it. It creates a reaction in the viewer whch is theirs alone. It only fails if not reaction is forthcoming. Brexit belongs to everyone except those who created it. 

Brexit as Mirror

Brexit means whatever the individual wants it to mean, because it was never defined. It is a vessel into which you can pour any suitable cause or idea. When you look into Brexit you see your prejudices reflected back at you. 

Brexit as Scripture

Followers of a belief are not defined by their scripture, but by how they interpret their scripture. To be a fundamentalist is to accept there is not other interpretation other than your own. But scripture is always open to interpretation, otherwise religion cannot survive. Brexit thrives because its meaning is not fixed.
