#Sociopolitical Areas of Interest

Loosely, these are the things that matter, and that it is worth making art about. 

##Methodology

I've struggled to match the technical and artistic things I'm interested in with the issues I care passionately about, and really want to bring these two parts of my brain together for this piece. And, most importantly, to do it without being a preaching arsehole. 

A big inspiration for this is how [James Bridle](http://booktwo.org/james-bridle/) approaches his work, particularly pieces like [Dronestagram](http://booktwo.org/notebook/dronestagram-drones-eye-view/) where rather than preach his work creates a space for discussion where previously there wasn't one. His motivation is passionate and angry, but when first encountered the work is neutral and open to all. I like that. 

##Surveillance 

You cannot talk about cameras in the 21st century without talking about surveillance. But CCTV cameras are quite old now and this issues that surround them have probably changed. I'd like to look at how urban surveillance has changed over the last decade with the introduction of computer vision and data crunching. And also look at where it fails and doesn't reflect the "security theatre". 

##Points of View

Where a camera is mounted or how a camera is held is a political decision. Body cameras on the Police are fascinating because they surveille their activities but only from their perspective. I'd like to look into this. 


##Cameras as tools of oppression

Photographing someone can be an agressive act against vulnerable and minority people, particularly those who work / live on the streets. Conversley, the act of not photographing aspects of a society make them invisible. Not many pictures of homeless people on the #birmingham Instagram.

>"In theory, we are all equally subject to being photographed, but the Street View collections often reveal it is the poor and the marginalized who fall within the purview of the Google camera gaze."
