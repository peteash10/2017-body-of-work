#Theoretical Areas of Interest

Enquiry into the production and consumption of images in the 21st century is a dauntingly huge challenge. My process over the next few months will be to narrow my areas of interest to a manageable number of subjects suitable for the production of new work. Here is the current list of ideas and approaches.


##Artificial Inteligence is Hard to See

[From Kate Crawford](https://medium.com/@katecrawford/artificial-intelligence-is-hard-to-see-a71e74f386db)

>There needs to be a strong research field that measures and assesses the social and economic effects of current AI systems, in order to strengthen AI’s positive impacts and mitigate its risks. By measuring the impacts of these technologies, we can strengthen the design and development of AI, assist public and private actors in ensuring their systems are reliable and accountable, and reduce the possibility of errors. By building an empirical understanding of how AI functions on the ground, we can establish evidence-led models for responsible and ethical deployment, and ensure the healthy growth of the AI field.

>If the social impacts of artificial intelligence are hard to see, it is critical to find rigorous ways to make them more visible and accountable. We need new tools to allow us to know how and when automated decisions are materially affecting our lives — and, if necessary, to contest them.

##Surveillance Capitalism

From [Big Other: Surveillance Capitalism and the Prospects of an Information Civilization](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2594754) by Shoshana Zuboff 

> Google is to surveillance capitalism what General Motors was to managerial capitalism. Therefore the institutionalizing practices and operational assumptions of Google Inc. are the primary lens for this analysis as they are rendered in two recent articles authored by Google Chief Economist Hal Varian. Varian asserts four uses that follow from computer-mediated transactions: ‘data extraction and analysis,’ ‘new contractual forms due to better monitoring,’ ‘personalization and customization,’ and ‘continuous experiments.’ An examination of the nature and consequences of these uses sheds light on the implicit logic of surveillance capitalism and the global architecture of computer mediation upon which it depends. 

##System Blindness

> According to Goleman, one of the worst results of systems blindness occurs when we implement a strategy to fix a problem but ignore the involved system dynamics. Many problems are, unfortunately, too macro or micro for us to notice directly.

>One example he gives is that of building more and wider roads to avoid traffic jams, which will eventually lead to even more traffic as people will take advantage of the better travel connections and move further away from urban areas. Another example is global warming. Energy and climate are a system. Everything that we’re doing is part of the healing of that system. It’s a systemic problem; climate meetings and agreements can only do so much.

>Likewise, everything that we’re doing affects the success and failure of our software systems. When something doesn’t work as expected, I want you to remember this lesson: There are no side effects, just effects that result from our flawed understanding of the system.

##Power

Specifically the power the person holding or controlling the camera (and/or the resulting images) has over the subject. I'm particularly interested in how this power can be neutered or combatted, and how when that happens it is seen as dangerous or (worse) stupid. 

Examples:

* Protesters photographing police photographers. 
* Selfies as an elimination of the photographer from the image making process. 
* Documenting CCTV and other surveillance infrastructure.

##Data-First Photography

What does it mean to compose a photograph for the data it will capture, rather than for the aesthetic pleasure it will give? Where do these two overlap? 

Is there any aesthetic value to be found in photographs taken purely for data? 

(See also [Vernacular Photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernacular_photography), maybe. People taking photos purely to record what was there, not concerned about it looking "nice".)

##There Is Only Software

To quote Lev Manovich:

> Depending on the software I am using, the “properties” of a media object can change dramatically. Exactly the same file with the same contents can take on a variety of identities depending on the software being used. What does this finding means in relation to the persisting primacy of the term “digital” in understanding new media? Let me answer this as clear and direct as I can. There is no such thing as “digital media.” There is only software – as applied to media data (or “content”).

*[There Is Only Software](http://manovich.net/index.php/projects/there-is-only-software), 2011. [PDF](https://github.com/peteash10/2017-body-of-work/blob/master/resources/Lev%20Manovich%20-%20There%20is%20Only%20Software.pdf)*

##Data Portraiture

Lots of things come under this, from Google, Facebook, etc generating profiles to Fitbit health data to DNA reconstructions and so on. The connection to photography is perhaps tenuous, but the connection to portraiture is fascinating. Is there a "painting > photography > data" line? Can a data portrait be "composed"? How might a data artist approach portraiture? 

##Vilem Flusser

The guy who started all this off for me, [thanks to James George](https://vimeo.com/134973504). I talk about my mild obsession with Flusser [at this point](https://vimeo.com/159868781#t=513s) of my BOM Fellows talk.
