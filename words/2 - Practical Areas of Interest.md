#Practical Areas of Interest

Enquiry into the production and consumption of images in the 21st century is a dauntingly huge challenge. My process over the next few months will be to narrow my areas of interest to a manageable number of subjects suitable for the production of new work. Here is the current list of tools, methods and practical approaches. 

##Computer Vision

From basic shape tracking to object recognition. A nice example of the latter is Kyle McDonald's piece [NeuralTalk and Walk](https://vimeo.com/146492001).

##Neural Networks

[Deep Dream](http://deepdreamgenerator.com), [Style Transfer](https://frankzliu.com/artistic-style-transfer/), etc. 


Images have been used as a diagnostic tool to understand how [convoluted neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) (complex algorithms which "learn") work, and in turn have images which provoke our understanding of creativity. 

Interesting to me because it is a non-visual way of understanding, and producing, visual images and has implications for computer vision.

###t-SNE Sorting

Related to neural networks t-SNE is a methodology for sorting images based on their contents. It's an interesting approach to dealing with thousands of images and something I want to explore. 

[Gene Kogan is doing work in this area](https://github.com/genekogan/ofxTSNE).

##Photogrammetry

[Photogrammetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogrammetry) is the process by which multiple photographs (or video frames) of the same object from different angles can be translated into a 3D rendering of that object. [Originally used](https://github.com/golanlevin/ExperimentalCapture/blob/master/docs/Photogrammetry-and-3D-scanning.md) to determine topographical heights from aerial photography this is now a common form of 3D scanning. The process involves identifying similar points in photos and calculating their position in 3D space. 

Interesting to me because photos as data and the translation from 2D to 3D. Also potentially very glitchy.

##Depth Capture

[LiDAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar) and [Kinect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect). They're cameras, but they're not cameras. Adding a new dimension of depth. See also [DepthKit](http://www.depthkit.tv) and work with the [LiDAR unit I recently bought](https://github.com/golanlevin/ExperimentalCapture/tree/master/students/benjamin/project3)

Interesting to me because they push the edges of "what is a camera" in a relatively comprehendible way, plus they really do just produce data which has to be rendered in an arbitrary way to be understood. 

Particularly want to rethink how they "see".

##Multispectral Imaging

Moving out of the visual RGB band and looking at non-visible light and radio waves.

* Near-Infrared (NIR) Imaging
* X-Ray Imaging
* Thermal Imaging
* Thermochromic Imaging
* Ultraviolet (UV) Imaging
* Radar
* Millimetre Wave & Terahertz Imaging
* CT Scans, MRI, CAT Etc.

[Good overview from Golan Levin.](https://github.com/golanlevin/ExperimentalCapture/blob/master/docs/hyperspectral.md)

Interesting because computers can capture the spectrums that we can't see.

##Photoviz

[Nicholas Felton](http://feltron.com)'s merging of photograph and data visualisation in [his book](http://feltron.com/PhotoViz.html) collecting examples from early photography to the present. 

Interesting as an accessible way to think of images as data.
