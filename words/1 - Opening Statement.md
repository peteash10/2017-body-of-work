<h1 id="toc_0">Opening Statement</h1>

<p>During 2017 I will be developing a new body of work, culminating in an exhibition at <a href="http://bom.org.uk">Birmingham Open Media</a> at the end of the year. </p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Artist Statement of Intent</h2>

<p><em>2nd draft: 15th September 2016.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://peteashton.com">Pete Ashton</a> is exploring the computer programmes, algorithms and Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> that inform our daily lives but are hidden or obscured from our comprehension<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. His practice uses ubiquitous cameras<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> and image analysis<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> to highlight the reach and biases of these complex systems and challenge the Silicon Valley orthodoxy of &quot;one system fits all&quot;<sup id="fnref5"><a href="#fn5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> as multinational tech companies expand from Internet services into the Smart Cities arena<sup id="fnref6"><a href="#fn6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>. </p>

<p>This rise in the capabilities of corporate AI coincides with the turmoil of late-capitalism and failure of austerity policies which have ravaged cities like the artist&#39;s hometown of Birmingham<sup id="fnref7"><a href="#fn7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>. As AI-powered systems are brought in to deliver efficiencies as much as services, Ashton&#39;s work highlights those parts of society which may suffer from a new digital divide<sup id="fnref8"><a href="#fn8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>. </p>

<p>While photograph image processing is a small part of the AI ecology, Ashton&#39;s camera-derived visual art makes these issues comprehendible and invites the viewer to explore broader questions about AI and society. Through collaboration with AI advocates<sup id="fnref9"><a href="#fn9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>, and those potentially disadvantaged by its implementation<sup id="fnref10"><a href="#fn10" rel="footnote">10</a></sup>, his work explores how algorithms can represent a city in unexpected ways and the questions that arise concerning their accuracy and social effects. </p>

<p>Ashton sees the photograph as just one way to visualise a camera&#39;s data and his camera-based work involves print, video, software, sound, statistical analysis, walking, sculpture, performance and other media.</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">New bit on using photography to illuminate AI to be worked in once it&#39;s clearer.</h3>

<p>Photographs have been described as being &quot;the annihilation of time and space&quot;, a Victorian-era phrase also applied to the telegraph and railroad which radically changed our relationship to the four dimensions, but mostly these days associated with <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/05/26/river-of-shadows-rebecca-solnit-muybridge/">Eadweard Muybridge&#39;s horses</a>.</p>

<p>This phrase is a potent one as it casually explains a photograph&#39;s relationship to reality (as it experienced by humans). A photograph is a 2D rendering of a slice though time. Anything before the shutter was opened and after it is closed is discarded. Simulaneously, the framing of the photograph discards everything behind, above, below, to the left and to the right of the lens&#39;s field of view. </p>

<p>Photography is powerful through what it excludes, not what it includes. A high-contrast, narrow depth-of-field, black and white photograph also throws out colour and detail, again increasing its power. Less is always more in photography. </p>

<p>As such, photography is a great metaphor for data analysis. If photography anihilates time and space, data analysis anihilates nuance and edge cases in search of patterns and trends. </p>

<p>When the outliers are people, and the questions being asked are politically motivated, who is left out of the picture? </p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence in this context is very complex algorithms which attempt to mimic processes of the brain. It does not necessarily imply &quot;intelligence&quot; in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">Turning Test</a> sense. Other terms include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network">Neural Networks</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">Machine Learning</a>.

<p>I see ubiquitous photography as the evolution of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernacular_photography">vernacular photography</a> and a further drift from elitist, professional photography. It describes a state where cameras, usually on phones, are effectively available to all and <a href="http://kottke.org/14/01/goodbye-cameras-hello-networked-lenses">connected to the network</a>. It also allows for cameras whose images are consumed directly by algorithms and never seen by humans. &nbsp;<a href="#fnref3" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision">Computer Vision</a> systems which use pattern matching systems to identify the contents of an image. Immediate examples include Google Image Search and software identifying your friends in photos. A nice example of developments in this area is Kyle McDonald&#39;s piece <a href="https://vimeo.com/146492001">NeuralTalk and Walk</a>.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref4" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>There appears to be a mythology in the entrepreneur start-up bubble of the one innovation which will solve all the problems at once with no need for another solution to complement it. Google is the only way to search, Facebook is the only way to do social networking, Uber is the only model for public transportation, and so on. In a healthy competitive market this is not a problem, but in a monopoly those who do not or cannot fit this model are excluded and suffer. cf <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Californian_Ideology">The Californian Ideology</a>&nbsp;<a href="#fnref5" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Much of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_city">Smart Cities</a> agenda involved large tech companies such as Google monopolising public services while promising social and financial benefits. There are, of course, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_issues_in_smart_cities">many issues</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/10/only-public-sector-finds-smart-technology-sexy?CMP=twt_gu">criticisms</a>.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref6" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Like most large British cities, Birmingham has suffered disproportionately from central government funding cuts with <a href="http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/expect-less-birmingham-city-council-9437162">mass redundancies and reductions in services</a>. Coupled with a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-20294633">bungled equal pay</a> legal case the city is on the verge of bankruptcy. &nbsp;<a href="#fnref7" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_divide">Digital Divide</a> has traditionally been about access to equipment and services. I propose the new divide is about how you are perceived and categorised by those services. &nbsp;<a href="#fnref8" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>
