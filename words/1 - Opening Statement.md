#Opening Statement

Being photographed invovles having a your visual appearance rendered as a flat image by a camera. But digital cameras are capable of much more than making photographs. As the ubiquity of cameras increases along with the ability to process the data they produce, the implications of being "caught on camera" are radically shifting. 

It is my contention that the networked digital camera is a wolf in sheep's clothing. It presents as an image making machine but is in fact a data capturing device, employed by companies and agencies to create a very different understanding of the world and our place in it. 

There are two responses to this. Kick out the wolf, or embrace the wolf. Both are valid. Both are worth exploring. 

##A New Body of Work

During 2017 I will be developing a new body of work, culminating in an exhibition at [Birmingham Open Media](http://bom.org.uk) at the end of the year. 

I want to explore what it means to be seen by a camera in the 21st century, how our selse of place is informed by cameras and similar devices, and what it might mean in the future as the technology behind surveilling develops and changes.
