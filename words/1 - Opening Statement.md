<h1 id="toc_0">Opening Statement</h1>

<p>During 2017 I will be developing a new body of work, culminating in an exhibition at <a href="http://bom.org.uk">Birmingham Open Media</a> at the end of the year. </p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Artist Statement</h2>

<p><em>Draft: 13th September 2016</em></p>

<p><a href="http://peteashton.com">Pete Ashton</a> is exploring the algorithms and AI systems<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> that increasingly inform our daily lives but which remain hidden or obscured from comprehension<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. His practice uses ubiquitous cameras<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> and image analysis processes<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> to highlight the reach and biases of these algo-driven systems<sup id="fnref5"><a href="#fn5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> and challenge the Silicon Valley orthodoxy<sup id="fnref6"><a href="#fn6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> of &quot;one system fits all&quot;<sup id="fnref7"><a href="#fn7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> as multinational tech companies move towards running public services<sup id="fnref8"><a href="#fn8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>. </p>

<p>Ashton&#39;s work frequently uses his home of Birmingham, a large city in central England with a long history of immigration<sup id="fnref9"><a href="#fn9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>. Ravaged by austerity<sup id="fnref10"><a href="#fn10" rel="footnote">10</a></sup>, struggling with regeneration<sup id="fnref11"><a href="#fn11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup> and with a population evenly split on Brexit<sup id="fnref12"><a href="#fn12" rel="footnote">12</a></sup>, Birmingham is a perfect storm of post-industrial, post-internet, post-truth turmoil and confusion onto which society is layering artificial intelligence systems.  </p>

<p>Through collaboration with those potentially disadvantaged by the algorithmic state alongside those advocating its expansion, Ashton&#39;s work creates a space for contemplation and critical discussion with the aim of understanding ourselves and our trajectory as a civilisation.</p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence in this context is very complex algorithms which attempt to mimic processes of the brain. It does not necessarily imply &quot;intelligence&quot; in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">Turning Test</a> sense. Other terms include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network">Neural Networks</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">Machine Learning</a>. See <a href="https://medium.com/@genekogan/machine-learning-for-artists-e93d20fdb097#.zets4x170">Machine Learning for Artists by Gene Kogan</a>. &nbsp;<a href="#fnref1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>

<li id="fn3">
<p>I see ubiquitous photography as the evolution of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernacular_photography">vernacular photography</a> and a further drift from elitist, professional photography. It describes a state where cameras, usually on phones, are effectively available to all and <a href="http://kottke.org/14/01/goodbye-cameras-hello-networked-lenses">connected to the network</a>. It also allows for cameras whose images are consumed directly by algorithms and never seen by humans. &nbsp;<a href="#fnref3" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>

<li id="fn4">
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision">Computer Vision</a> systems which use pattern matching algorithms to identify the contents of an image. Immediate examples include Google Image Search and software identifying your friends in photos. A nice example is Kyle McDonald&#39;s piece <a href="https://vimeo.com/146492001">NeuralTalk and Walk</a>.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref4" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Photography is only a small part of the AI ecology but it is probably the most easily comprehendible. I use camera-derived visual art to highlight the broader issues around AI and society.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref5" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>

<li id="fn7">
<p>There appears to be a mythology in the entrepreneur start-up bubble of the one innovation which will solve all the problems at once with no need for another solution to complement it. Google is the only way to search, Facebook is the only way to do social networking, Uber is the only model for public transportation, and so on. In a healthy competitive market this is not a problem, but in a monopoly those who do not or cannot fit this model are excluded and suffer. &nbsp;<a href="#fnref7" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>

<li id="fn8">
<p>Much of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_city">Smart Cities</a> agenda involves large tech companies such as Google monopolising public services while promising social and financial benefits. There are, of course, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_issues_in_smart_cities">many issues</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/10/only-public-sector-finds-smart-technology-sexy?CMP=twt_gu">criticisms</a>.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref8" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>

<li id="fn9">
<p>As a Victorian city at the heart of the Industrial Revolution, Birmingham grew rapidly and always attracted immigrants, notably Irish, Indian/Pakistani, Caribbean and recently East European. While headline <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_Birmingham">demographic numbers</a> imply a multicultural community, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_Birmingham#Ethnicity">local breakdowns</a> reveal a city quite strongly divided on ethnic lines. Questions about Birmingham&#39;s fluid identity are fraught with complexity and often oversimplified for political gain.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref9" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>

<li id="fn10">
<p>Like most large British cities, Birmingham has suffered disproportionately from central government funding cuts with <a href="%5B%5Eausterity%5D">mass redundancies and reductions in services</a>. Coupled with a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-20294633">bungled equal pay</a> legal case the city is on the verge of bankruptcy. &nbsp;<a href="#fnref10" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>

<li id="fn11">
<p>Unlike the masterplans of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Chamberlain#Mayor_of_Birmingham">Victorian</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Manzoni">post-war</a> periods, the current <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_City_Plan">Big City Plan</a> is a rudderless vessel, buffeted by the whims of national and supranational interests. The city has no control over its future. &nbsp;<a href="#fnref11" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Results_of_the_United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum,_2016#West_Midlands">As a city</a>, Birmingham roughly reflected the national vote (49.6% remain, 50.4% leave) but <a href="https://www.birmingham.gov.uk/downloads/file/3270/eu_referendum_results_2016_by_constituency_and_ward">across the districts</a> white working class areas mostly voted leave while others were remain. &nbsp;<a href="#fnref12" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>
