#Potential Collaborators

A wish-list of people and entities I'd like to collaborate with during the development of this work. Contingent on them being a) interested and b) available. 

I am very open to suggestions of other people and entities I should consider approaching. 

*	[James George](http://jamesgeorge.org/) at [Scatter](http://scatter.nyc) gave the talk that probably inspired me to start all this. I saw him at Resonate but [the Eyeo talk is the same](https://vimeo.com/134973504). 

*	[Golan Levin](http://www.flong.com) ran the [Experimental Capture](http://golancourses.net/capture2016/) workshop I attended in 2016. He directs the [Studio for Creative Enquiry](http://studioforcreativeinquiry.org) at CMU. At very least will know of lots of people who I might want to collaborate with. 

* [Zac Lieberman](http://thesystemis.com/about/) is similar to Golan in that he's a practitioner and a teacher who will know people of interest. A conversation will be in order.

* [School of Machines, Making & Make-Believe](http://schoolofma.org). Looks simlar to BOM in outlook and runs courses that cover areas of interest to me. Could be worth exploring who is involved. 

*	[The Centre for the Study of the Networked Image](http://www.centreforthestudyof.net) at London South Bank University seems to be exploring a lot of areas I'm interested in and has a collaboration with [The Photographer's Gallery](http://thephotographersgallery.org.uk). 


##Galleries and Festival I'll be approaching

Again, I'm open to suggestions.

*	[The Photographer's Gallery](http://thephotographersgallery.org.uk), London
* [Open Eye](http://openeye.org.uk), Liverpool
* [Abandon Normal Devices](http://www.andfestival.org.uk)
