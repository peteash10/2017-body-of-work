#Potential Collaborators

A wish-list of people and entities I'd like to collaborate with during the development of this work. Contingent on them being a) interested and b) available. 

I am very open to suggestions of other people and entities I should consider approaching. 

##People

* [Rick Robinson](https://theurbantechnologist.com) - IT Director for Smart Data and Technology for Amey, founder and the current chair of the [Birmingham Smart City Alliance](https://birminghamsmartcityalliance.wordpress.com). 
[Interview with him.](https://www.newcivilengineer.com/latest/nce-live/project-profile-smart-infrastructure/10008429.article) 

* [Kate Crawford](http://www.katecrawford.net) "is a Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research New York City, a Visiting Professor at MIT's Center for Civic Media, and a Senior Fellow at NYU's Information Law Institute. Her research addresses the social implications of large scale data, machine learning and AI."

*	[Nathan Jurgenson](http://nathanjurgenson.com) "is a sociologist and social media theorist, the founder and editor in chief of Real Life magazine, the co-founder and chair of the Theorizing the Web conference, a contributing editor of the New Inquiry, and a researcher at Snapchat." 


* [Gene Kogan](http://www.genekogan.com) is the Neural Networks go-to-guy. [Here's a good overview talk](https://vimeo.com/180044029) by him. See also everyone involved with [Alt-AI](http://alt-ai.net), a conference for using AI in art. At the very least I should go through his [Machine Learning for Artists](http://ml4a.github.io/classes/itp-S16/) classes.

*	[James George](http://jamesgeorge.org/) at [Scatter](http://scatter.nyc) gave the talk that probably inspired me to start all this. I saw him at Resonate but [the Eyeo talk is the same](https://vimeo.com/134973504). 

*	[Golan Levin](http://www.flong.com) ran the [Experimental Capture](http://golancourses.net/capture2016/) workshop I attended in 2016. He directs the [Studio for Creative Enquiry](http://studioforcreativeinquiry.org) at CMU. At very least will know of lots of people who I might want to collaborate with. 

* [Zac Lieberman](http://thesystemis.com/about/) is similar to Golan in that he's a practitioner and a teacher who will know people of interest. A conversation will be in order.

* [Denis Connolly & Anne Cleary](http://www.connolly-cleary.com) for their work on perceptual devices, particularly the [Metaperceptual Helmets](http://www.connolly-cleary.com/Home/helmets.html) which I saw last year. 

##Organisations

* [Centrala](http://centrala-space.org.uk). I have connections with a Polish ex-pat community in Birmingham based around the Centrala cafe/gallery in Digbeth who have been quite vocal post-Brexit.

* [Crisis Skylight](http://www.crisis.org.uk/pages/crisis-skylight-birmingham.html). I did some photography work for their [Art in Crisis](http://www.crisis.org.uk/pages/art-in-crisis-birmingham.html) festival, working with vulneralble adults, and found it very rewarding and interesting. I'd like to collaborate with them again.

* [School for Poetic Computation](http://sfpc.io) "is an artist run school in New York that was founded in 2013. A small group of students and faculty work closely to explore the intersections of code, design, hardware and theory — focusing especially on artistic intervention. It’s a hybrid of a school, residency and research group."

* [School of Machines, Making & Make-Believe](http://schoolofma.org). Looks similar to BOM in outlook and runs courses that cover areas of interest to me. Could be worth exploring who is involved. 

*	[The Centre for the Study of the Networked Image](http://www.centreforthestudyof.net) at London South Bank University seems to be exploring a lot of areas I'm interested in and has a collaboration with [The Photographer's Gallery](http://thephotographersgallery.org.uk). 


##Galleries and Festivals I'll be approaching

Some for exhibiting the work, some for talking about the work (some for both). 

Again, I'm open to suggestions.

*	[The Photographer's Gallery](http://thephotographersgallery.org.uk), London
* [Open Eye](http://openeye.org.uk), Liverpool
* [Abandon Normal Devices](http://www.andfestival.org.uk)
* [Resonate](http://resonate.io)
* [Eyeo](http://eyeofestival.com)
* [Future Everything](http://futureeverything.org)
