#Inspirational Works

A small selection of works by others which have or will inform and inspire my practice. 

##[NeuralTalk and Walk](https://vimeo.com/146492001)

Kyle McDonald adapts the Recurrent Neural Network captioning programme [NeuralTalk2](https://github.com/karpathy/neuraltalk2) to run on his laptop webcam stream and walks around Amsterdam.

2013 | Pablo Garcia

Transforming Albrecht Dürer's study of human profiles into an extruded 3D model which casts a shadow. I want to create "photographs" that are not restricted to a piece of paper or flat screen. Sculpture is always on my mind. w

2011 | James George & Alexander Porter

>Only six weeks after the tragic 2005 subway bombings in London, New York's Metro Transit Authority (MTA) signed a contract with the high-tech defense and military technology giant Lockheed Martin for the promise of a high-tech surveillance system driven by computer vision and artificial intelligence. The security system failed miserably and the contract collapsed under lawsuits. As a result, thousands of security cameras in the New York subway stations sit unused and the public is kept safe through old fashion methods of law enforcement.

>The Depth Editor Debug series imagines what the world would have looked like through the eyes of that system. 

##[Alfons Schilling's Vision Machines](http://www.alfonsschilling.net/werke/sehmaschinen/)

Schilling was an Austrian artist who did pioneering work in VR and perception art. All his work is of interest but I'm particularly fascinated by his vision-altering contraptions. Often bulky and awkward, they restrict the vision of the wearer and change how they perceive the world. 

I would like to build something similar which simulates how different cameras and capture devices "see the world". For example, as a [rolling-shutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_shutter) or a [slit-scan](http://flong.com/texts/lists/slit_scan/).

by R. Luke DuBois

A three day performance piece by Lián Amaris Sifuente which was recorded and edited into a one hour video piece by DuBois. Inspirational as an example of a video/photographer collaborating 100% with a performer, something I hope to do either through this project or alongside it. 

See also [Manuel Vason](http://manuelvason.com)'s collaboration work.

[Manuel Vason](http://manuelvason.com)

A fascinating performance art project exploring what it means to be a photographer. Particularly like the [Becoming an Action](http://photoperformer.com/becoming-an-action/) piece. 

##[Metaperceptual Helmets](http://www.connolly-cleary.com/Home/helmets.html)

by [Connolly Cleary](http://www.connolly-cleary.com/), helmets which effectively move the eyeballs to locations found in other creatures to mimic how they see the world. Interesting how the human brain adjusts over time to wearing them. Would like to build similar devices! 

##[Immaterials: Light painting WiFi](https://vimeo.com/20412632)

>This project explores the invisible terrain of WiFi networks in urban spaces by light painting signal strength in long-exposure photographs. A four-metre tall measuring rod with 80 points of light reveals cross-sections through WiFi networks using a photographic technique called light-painting.
