#Practical Plan

Chose an area of the city that has a lot of activity and "capture" it over a period of months using a variety of devices.

Represent that area using the data and images captured in ways that shed new light on it, helping people to understand the area, and the wider city, anew. 

Outcomes include computational photography, 3D environments, multispectral imaging, social history, mass documentation. 

##Location ideas

###Pagoda Roundabout

Close to BOM. Have got permissions to use it before. Liminal space on ring road. Lots of pedestrian traffic. Lots of road traffic. Paradoxical zen garden. Street drinking population. Overlooked by four tall buildings. Contains public art and history of city. Neglected but a landmark all locals know.

##Activity ideas

Noting them as they come to me. To be developed, merged or discarded as appropriate over time. 

###Group Capture

A group of people, maybe school kids, maybe vulnerable or minority people, capture an area of the city with a variety of devices across a range of spectrums and media. This is then turned into a piece of some kind. Multi-authored, directed by me. 

Collaborate with a school or an organisation like Crisis. 

###Camera robot

A multi-lens, multi-wave, sensory device that captures it's surroundings based on algorithms / data fed to it. Lives in a city square.

###Muliple PoVs

Get access to windows and viewpoints overlooking the area under study, views which are only seen by a small number of people but for extended periods (ie, someone's office desk). Portraits of the people with their view? 

###Race filter

Take multiple photos from a static camera of an area and edit them to produce a series of images where all people are of same ethnicity. Highlight diversity of city by erasing it. 

###Archive of insignificant features

Treating the small and insignificant aspects of the environment as if they were precious objects to be studied and archived. From bricks to lichen to decorative features on railings. 

###Multi POV narration

Ask a number of people to record themselves narrating everything around them in a public space at the same time. Video the scene simultaneously. Sync all recordings so viewers can switch between POVs. 

###Eye tracker vs computer vision. 

Compare how different people explore an image using an eyetracker, and then compare that with how different computer vision systems look at images. cf [Robot Readable World](https://vimeo.com/36239715). Inspired in part by [Alexis Lloyd's Eyeo 2015](https://vimeo.com/175846583) talk on developing collaborative relatioships with machines. 

###Mapping with the community.

Riffing off community engagement tactics from georgraphers, etc, giving maps and renders to the public to get them to fill in the gaps with their local knowledge. Something about seeing how different images and scans of an area (Lidar, map, aerial photo, ground photos, multispectral) can inform how people explore it on the ground.
