#Practical Plan

Chose an area of the city that has a lot of activity and "capture" it over a period of months using a variety of devices.

Represent that area using the data and images captured in ways that shed new light on it, helping people to understand the area, and the wider city, anew. 

Outcomes include computational photography, 3D environments, multispectral imaging, social history, mass documentation. 

##Location ideas

###Pagoda Roundabout

Close to BOM. Have got permissions to use it before. Liminal space on ring road. Lots of pedestrian traffic. Lots of road traffic. Paradoxical zen garden. Street drinking population. Overlooked by four tall buildings. Contains public art and history of city. Neglected but a landmark all locals know.

##Activity ideas

Noting them as they come to me. To be developed, merged or discarded as appropriate over time. 

###Polish community post-Brexit



###Group Capture

A group of people, maybe school kids, maybe vulnerable or minority people, capture an area of the city with a variety of devices across a range of spectrums and media. This is then turned into a piece of some kind. Multi-authored, directed by me. 

Collaborate with a school or an organisation like Crisis. 

###Camera robot

A multi-lens, multi-wave, sensory device that captures it's surroundings based on algorithms / data fed to it. Lives in a city square.

###Muliple PoVs

Get access to windows and viewpoints overlooking the area under study, views which are only seen by a small number of people but for extended periods (ie, someone's office desk). Portraits of the people with their view? 

###Archive of insignificant features

Treating the small and insignificant aspects of the environment as if they were precious objects to be studied and archived. From bricks to lichen to decorative features on railings.
