#Practical Ideas

Noting them as they come to me. To be developed, merged or discarded as appropriate over time. 

##Group Capture

A group of people, maybe school kids, maybe vulnerable or minority people, capture an area of the city with a variety of devices across a range of spectrums and media. This is then turned into a piece of some kind. Multi-authored, directed by me. 

Collaborate with a school or an organisation like Crisis. 

##Camera robot

A multi-lens, multi-wave, sensory device that captures it's surroundings based on algorithms / data fed to it. Lives in a city square.
