#Opening Statement

During 2017 I will be developing a new body of work, culminating in an exhibition at [Birmingham Open Media](http://bom.org.uk) at the end of the year. 

##Artist Statement of Intent

*2nd draft: 15th September 2016.*

[Pete Ashton](http://peteashton.com) is exploring the computer programmes, algorithms and Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems[^AI] that inform our daily lives but are hidden or obscured from our comprehension[^Crawford]. His practice uses ubiquitous cameras[^ubiquitous] and image analysis[^cv] to highlight the reach and biases of these complex systems and challenge the Silicon Valley orthodoxy of "one system fits all"[^onering] as multinational tech companies expand from Internet services into the Smart Cities arena[^smartcities]. 

This rise in the capabilities of corporate AI coincides with the turmoil of late-capitalism and failure of austerity policies which have ravaged cities like the artist's hometown of Birmingham[^austerity]. As AI-powered systems are brought in to deliver efficiencies as much as services, Ashton's work highlights those parts of society which may suffer from a new digital divide[^Digidivide]. 

While photograph image processing is a small part of the AI ecology, Ashton's camera-derived visual art makes these issues comprehendible and invites the viewer to explore broader questions about AI and society. Through collaboration with AI advocates[^Digibrum], and those potentially disadvantaged by its implementation[^Victims], his work explores how AI can represent a city in unexpected ways and the questions that arise concerning their accuracy and social effects. 

Ashton sees the photograph as just one way to visualise a camera's data and his camera-based work involves print, video, software, sound, statistical analysis, walking, sculpture, performance and other media.

[^Victims]: For example, [Predictive Policing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_policing) has run into [accusations of amplifying biases](http://www.civilrights.org/press/2016/predictive-policing-statement.html). 

[^Digibrum]: See [Digital Birmingham's Smart City Roadmap](http://digitalbirmingham.co.uk/service/smart-cities/) and the [Birmingham Smart City Alliance](https://birminghamsmartcityalliance.wordpress.com)

[^AI]: Artificial Intelligence in this context is very complex algorithms which attempt to mimic processes of the brain. It does not necessarily imply "intelligence" in a [Turning Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test) sense. Other terms include [Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) and [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning). See [Machine Learning for Artists by Gene Kogan](https://medium.com/@genekogan/machine-learning-for-artists-e93d20fdb097#.zets4x170). 


[^Crawford]: See Kate Crawford: [Artificial Intelligence is hard to see](https://medium.com/@katecrawford/artificial-intelligence-is-hard-to-see-a71e74f386db)

[^ubiquitous]: I see ubiquitous photography as the evolution of [vernacular photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernacular_photography) and a further drift from elitist, professional photography. It describes a state where cameras, usually on phones, are effectively available to all and [connected to the network](http://kottke.org/14/01/goodbye-cameras-hello-networked-lenses). It also allows for cameras whose images are consumed directly by algorithms and never seen by humans. 

[^cv]: [Computer Vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision) systems which use pattern matching systems to identify the contents of an image. Immediate examples include Google Image Search and software identifying your friends in photos. A nice example of developments in this area is Kyle McDonald's piece [NeuralTalk and Walk](https://vimeo.com/146492001).

[^smartcities]: Much of the [Smart Cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_city) agenda involved large tech companies such as Google monopolising public services while promising social and financial benefits. There are, of course, [many issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_issues_in_smart_cities) and [criticisms](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/10/only-public-sector-finds-smart-technology-sexy?CMP=twt_gu).
 
[^onering]: There appears to be a mythology in the entrepreneur start-up bubble of the one innovation which will solve all the problems at once with no need for another solution to complement it. Google is the only way to search, Facebook is the only way to do social networking, Uber is the only model for public transportation, and so on. In a healthy competitive market this is not a problem, but in a monopoly those who do not or cannot fit this model are excluded and suffer. cf [The Californian Ideology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Californian_Ideology)




[^austerity]: Like most large British cities, Birmingham has suffered disproportionately from central government funding cuts with [mass redundancies and reductions in services](http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/expect-less-birmingham-city-council-9437162). Coupled with a [bungled equal pay](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-20294633) legal case the city is on the verge of bankruptcy. 



[^Digidivide]: The [Digital Divide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_divide) has traditionally been about access to equipment and services. I propose the new divide is about how you are perceived and categorised by those services.
