#Potential Collaborators

A wish-list of people and entities I'd like to collaborate with during the development of this work. Contingent on them being a) interested and b) available. 

("Collaboration" could also just mean reading their work and maybe sending a couple of emails.)

I am very open to suggestions of other people and entities I should consider approaching. 

##People

* [Tess Osbourne](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/gees/people/dr-students/osborne-tess.aspx) - "Technogeographer at the University of Birmingham. Interested in emotions, bio-sensing, memory, brains, and mobilities." Potentially interested in my working with her PhD data. 

* [Wesley Goatley](http://www.wesleygoatley.com/about) - "I’m an artist and researcher based in London, UK. My practice examines opaque power and hidden processes in data and technology through installations, objects, and talks.  I’m currently undertaking doctoral studies through a scholarship from the Sussex Humanities Lab,  University of Sussex, where I’m exploring a critical data aesthetics approach to artistic practice and research."

* [Rick Robinson](https://theurbantechnologist.com) - IT Director for Smart Data and Technology for Amey, founder and the current chair of the [Birmingham Smart City Alliance](https://birminghamsmartcityalliance.wordpress.com). 
[Interview with him.](https://www.newcivilengineer.com/latest/nce-live/project-profile-smart-infrastructure/10008429.article) 

* [Kate Crawford](http://www.katecrawford.net) "is a Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research New York City, a Visiting Professor at MIT's Center for Civic Media, and a Senior Fellow at NYU's Information Law Institute. Her research addresses the social implications of large scale data, machine learning and AI."

*	[Nathan Jurgenson](http://nathanjurgenson.com) "is a sociologist and social media theorist, the founder and editor in chief of Real Life magazine, the co-founder and chair of the Theorizing the Web conference, a contributing editor of the New Inquiry, and a researcher at Snapchat." 

* [Gene Kogan](http://www.genekogan.com) is the Neural Networks go-to-guy. [Here's a good overview talk](https://vimeo.com/180044029) by him. See also everyone involved with [Alt-AI](http://alt-ai.net), a conference for using AI in art. At the very least I should go through his [Machine Learning for Artists](http://ml4a.github.io/classes/itp-S16/) classes.

*	[James George](http://jamesgeorge.org/) at [Scatter](http://scatter.nyc) gave the talk that probably inspired me to start all this. I saw him at Resonate but [the Eyeo talk is the same](https://vimeo.com/134973504). 

*	[Golan Levin](http://www.flong.com) ran the [Experimental Capture](http://golancourses.net/capture2016/) workshop I attended in 2016. He directs the [Studio for Creative Enquiry](http://studioforcreativeinquiry.org) at CMU. At very least will know of lots of people who I might want to collaborate with. 

* [Zac Lieberman](http://thesystemis.com/about/) is similar to Golan in that he's a practitioner and a teacher who will know people of interest. A conversation will be in order.

* [Denis Connolly & Anne Cleary](http://www.connolly-cleary.com) for their work on perceptual devices, particularly the [Metaperceptual Helmets](http://www.connolly-cleary.com/Home/helmets.html) which I saw last year. 

##Organisations

* [Centrala](http://centrala-space.org.uk). I have connections with a Polish ex-pat community in Birmingham based around the Centrala cafe/gallery in Digbeth who have been quite vocal post-Brexit.

* [Crisis Skylight](http://www.crisis.org.uk/pages/crisis-skylight-birmingham.html). I did some photography work for their [Art in Crisis](http://www.crisis.org.uk/pages/art-in-crisis-birmingham.html) festival, working with vulneralble adults, and found it very rewarding and interesting. I'd like to collaborate with them again.

* [School for Poetic Computation](http://sfpc.io) "is an artist run school in New York that was founded in 2013. A small group of students and faculty work closely to explore the intersections of code, design, hardware and theory — focusing especially on artistic intervention. It’s a hybrid of a school, residency and research group."

* [School of Machines, Making & Make-Believe](http://schoolofma.org). Looks similar to BOM in outlook and runs courses that cover areas of interest to me. Could be worth exploring who is involved. 

*	[The Centre for the Study of the Networked Image](http://www.centreforthestudyof.net) at London South Bank University seems to be exploring a lot of areas I'm interested in and has a collaboration with [The Photographer's Gallery](http://thephotographersgallery.org.uk). 


##Galleries and Festivals I'll be approaching

Some for exhibiting the work, some for talking about the work (some for both). 

Again, I'm open to suggestions.
