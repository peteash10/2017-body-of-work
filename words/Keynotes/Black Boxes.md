## Black Boxes

Something fairly straight forward. The concept of the [Black Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box). 

This does not refer to the [flight recorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_recorder) on a doomed aircraft. It refers to "a device, system or object which can be viewed in terms of its inputs and outputs without any knowledge of its internal workings."

This can be a literally closed system where seeing inside is either impossible or restricted by legal or proprietary means, or it can be something so massively complex as to be effectively unknowable. The former happens a lot (Google's search algorithm being kept secret), but the latter is particularly interesting to me as Deep Learning systems, a form of AI that learns from observation, are black boxes even to the people who create them. 

[The Dark Secret at the Heart of AI](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/604087/the-dark-secret-at-the-heart-of-ai/) looks like the kind of click-bait scare article about machine learning, but it's a really good overview of this conundrum. "No one really knows how the most advanced algorithms do what they do."

> The workings of any machine-learning technology are inherently more opaque, even to computer scientists, than a hand-coded system. This is not to say that all future AI techniques will be equally unknowable. But by its nature, deep learning is a particularly dark black box.

> You can’t just look inside a deep neural network to see how it works. A network’s reasoning is embedded in the behaviour of thousands of simulated neurons, arranged into dozens or even hundreds of intricately interconnected layers. The neurons in the first layer each receive an input, like the intensity of a pixel in an image, and then perform a calculation before outputting a new signal. These outputs are fed, in a complex web, to the neurons in the next layer, and so on, until an overall output is produced. Plus, there is a process known as back-propagation that tweaks the calculations of individual neurons in a way that lets the network learn to produce a desired output.

This is fascinating because it mirrors how we deal with other conscious entities such as people and other animals. Other minds are black boxes to us. I can give you instructions and you may or may not obey to some degree of accuracy. All I can do is tailor my instructions in such a way that I think will ensure the optimal result, maybe using an [NLP spell book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming). How and why your brain processes them the way it does is a total mystery to me. The best I can hope to do is train you, through repeated instruction, until you produce an acceptable result.
