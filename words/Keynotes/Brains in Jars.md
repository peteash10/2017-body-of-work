## Brains in Jars

A classic philosophical conundrum is the [brain in a jar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_in_a_vat) paradox which very simply says, if we can only know the world through our senses, and if our senses are simply sending signals to our brains, how do with know that our brains are actually getting these signals from our senses and not from a computer? How do we know we're not a brain wired up to a simulation? And yes, The Matrix is basically a film about this. 

What interests me about this isn't so much the answer, (like all good philosophy it's all about the question, not the answer) but the mechanics of it all. Let's break down how we perceive. 

There is the world, full of light and noise and stuff. Our senses are trigged by all this light and noise and stimulate parts of our brains. Our brains then somehow turn these signals into an awareness of the world. 

There's a lot of transduction going on here, converting one sort of energy or signal into another. How does light entering the eye become awareness of colour and shapes? How does sound vibrating bones in the ear become awareness of pitch and volume? 

A simple answer is that the brain processes the information given to it and creates a mental model of the world, which is good enough, but leads to another question. To what end? 

I know from working with photography that we do not see the world accurately because cameras often do get the world right and have to be corrected so they look "right" to us. Our brains shift blue and orange light towards white, effectively doing [White Balance correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_balance), so we can see better. This is helpful for dealing with the world, but it's not a true reflection of reality. In this, and many other ways, we are constantly Photoshopping our perception of the world so we can function more effectively in it.

So what we think of as our knowledge about the world is filtered through a process which has evolved for a purpose close to but not exactly the same as "showing us an accurate representation of the world". Which makes sense as we exist to spread our genes and everything we do has to support that. That we also appear to have developed a fairly accurate way of comprehending reality is a bonus. 

How does this relate to my bigger picture? There's a layer between "us" and the world and we don't, or can't, understand it. AI and Machine Learning systems are like that.
