## Magic

This is about the power of words (and my extension all media, which in turn is simply binary data) to change the world. I find exploring "magic" rather perilous as it's full of mystical bollocks and pretentious wankery, but I've found it to be a very fruitful way of understanding how irrational things can come about in societies which profess to be governed by rational thought. Here's my attempt to synthesise it into into something useful. 

Magic is about effecting change in the material world without a material cause. This is, of course, impossible. You cannot move objects with your mind. But you can use your mind to convince another mind to move an object. By this definition, which I choose to use, saying "please move that object" to someone and them moving it is a successful magical act. It's not very impressive, but it's a start. 

Magicians use spells and ritual. A spell is a bunch of words said in a specific order (spell being similar to "spelling" was a big clue to me here) which, when spoken, has the potential to effect change. A ritual is something done over and over again to strengthen an idea or concept. 

Politicians campaigning for elections are magicians casting spells which are strengthened through ritual gatherings. By standing on a stage and repeating their rhetoric, amplified by their supporters, they effect change. This can be shockingly powerful, as seen on the [face of Boris Johnson](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/boris-johnson-looked-sick-because-he-has-no-idea-how-fix-national-disaster-hes-bequeathed-us-1567413) the day after he accidentally made Brexit happen. 

We live in a weird world where we seem to believe that we are only influenced by tangible things that affect physical security and that of our property, but we make no attempt to protect what you might call our ideaspace. We don't like to think that our closely held beliefs and ideas are vulnerable to attack by forces that don't have our best interests at heart. 

All media exists to change your mind in some way. That is its purpose. Media is a vehicle for transferring ideas into your head where they mix with other ideas and create a slightly new version of your mental self, and this is a good thing. Change is good. We call this learning or broadening your horizons. The buzz you get after seeing a great film is your mind being changed. This is also a handy definition of great art. 

But it can also be weaponised to enact change in quite specific ways and to bypass or work against your pre-existing ideas and beliefs. This comes in many forms but the most prevalent is advertising and PR. This uses the gaps between how we perceive the world and how we *think* we perceive the world to trick us into changing our behaviour while making us believe we controlled that change. And the most dangerous thing about it is I don't think the practitioners of these dark arts know what they're actually doing. 

(As you can probably tell I hate advertising and won't have it in the house. Evil, evil stuff.)

So Brexit and Trump happened by magic, which is how everything in social situations happens. Think about Theresa May's phrase, "the will of the people". How can a collective "will" mean anything? If "the people" stood in front of a mountain and "willed" it to move, would it? But the will of the people can undo 70 years of European stability and plunge the world into a new uncertainty.

Trump used magic, but he also showed how much of the USA is based on magical thinking. The belief system of the United States is so strong that Americans seem to believe it to be invulnerable, but it's ultimately based on a collection of words. The [Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution) is a magical document, probably the most magical secular document of our age, because it supports the infrastructure and systems of a superpower with incredible authority. Trump's people (I'm thinking of Bannon here) have been poking at this and it's been fascinating to see Americans suddenly become aware of the fragility of their country's foundations. 

At least in a constitutional monarchy like the UK the absurd magic that keeps the country together is overt, yet many arguments for Brexit are based on pushing this mythology to its limit. I guess having had an empire will do that. 

So what's my point. Sure, magic isn't real, but then neither is art, and it's the best way I've found to group and explain all the irrational stuff in our societies. And I think it can also explain our approach and acceptance of AI systems. 

Lots to unpack though...
