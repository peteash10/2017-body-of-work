#How do digital cameras see?

How a digital camera works is very similar to the human eye. Reflected light is focussed by a lens through a hole and onto an array of receptors. These receptors send signals to the brain which understands them as vision. This has been understood since [Alhazen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen) wrote his Book of Optics in 1015 where he also outlined the principles of the Camera Obscura for the first time (and pretty much set up the principles of modern scientific enquiry).

Perhaps because of this mechanical similarity we often think of cameras as "eyes". When confronted with the business end of a camera we feel not just seen but watched, in the sense that our image is being saved and used somewhere, potentially to make a judgement. The camera is not and end in itself. It is assumed to be the start of a process by which images are not just made but consumed and processed by entities out of our personal control.
