#How do digital cameras see?

How a digital camera works is very similar to the human eye. Reflected light is focussed by a lens through a hole and onto an array of receptors. These receptors send signals to the brain which understands them as vision. This has been understood since [Alhazen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen) wrote his Book of Optics circa 1015, where he also outlined the principles of the Camera Obscura for the first time (and pretty much set up the principles of modern scientific enquiry).

Perhaps because of this mechanical similarity we often think of cameras as "eyes". When confronted with the business end of a camera we feel not just seen but watched, in the sense that our image is being saved and used somewhere, potentially to make a judgement. The camera is not and end in itself. It is assumed to be the start of a process by which images are consumed and processed by entities, communities and organisations out of our personal control. This applies to the teen posting to Instagram, the professional with the DSLR, the CCTV camera mounted on a building and so on. 

Like the eye, the camera is not where the work happens. It's just a gate, letting in light on command. The real work happens in the brain where the signals are turned into something useful. 

In traditional photography that "something useful" is a flat 2D rendering, and in the case of cinema a sequence of 2D renders, and once that rendering is completed it is fixed and will not change, except to degrade. 

Digital photography can also produce fixed 2D renders but digital **photographs** are anything but. Their natural state is to be constantly changing their size, resolution, quality and content as they move through programmes, services and platforms across the network. A digital photograph is really a string of digits which needs to be decoded and turned into an image. A digital movie file is not a sequence of frames but code describing the difference between the frames over time.
