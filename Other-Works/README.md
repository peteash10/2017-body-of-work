#Other works of mine which led up to this project

These will have archives devoted to them as I build up my new web presence over time.

##Speculative Cameras

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peteash10/2017-body-of-work/master/images/camera-icon.png)

This was the prelude, the scrapbook I was making before finding focus. Inspired by [a talk by James George](https://vimeo.com/134973504) and riffing of [Vilém Flusser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilém_Flusser)'s ideas about the social, political and econonmic systems that inform photography.

Peaked with an exhibition and talk during [Birmingham Open Media's Live R&D season](http://www.bom.org.uk/event/live-rd-exhibition-co-working-2/) in March 2016. Now folded into this project.
