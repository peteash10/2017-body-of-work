#Areas of Interest

Enquiry into the production and consumption of images in the 21st century is a dauntingly huge challenge. My process over the next few months will be to narrow my areas of interest to a manageable number of subjects suitable for the production of new work. Here is the current list. 

##Neural Networks

[Deep Dream](http://deepdreamgenerator.com), [Style Transfer](https://frankzliu.com/artistic-style-transfer/), etc. 


Images have been used as a diagnostic tool to understand how [convoluted neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) (complex algorithms which "learn") work, and in turn have images which provoke our understanding of creativity. 

Interesting to me because it is a non-visual way of understanding, and producing, visual images and has implications for computer vision. 

##Photogrammetry

[Photogrammetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogrammetry) is the process by which multiple photographs (or video frames) of the same object from different angles can be translated into a 3D rendering of that object. Originally used to determine topographical heights from aerial photography this is now a common form of 3D scanning. The process involves identifting similar points in photos and calcuating their position in 3D space. 

Interesting to me because photos as data and the translation from 2D to 3D. Also very glitchy.

##Depth Capture

[LiDAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar) and [Kinect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect). They're cameras, but they're not cameras. Adding a new dimension of depth. See also [DepthKit](http://www.depthkit.tv). 

Interesting to me because they push the edges of "what is a camera" in a relatively comprehendable way, plus they really do just produce data which has to be rendered in an arbitrary way to be understood. 

Particularly want to rethink how they "see".
