#Potential Collaborators

A wish-list of people and entities I'd like to collaborate with during the development of this work. Contingent on them being a) interested and b) available. 

I am very open to suggestions of other people and entities I should consider approaching. 

*	[James George](http://jamesgeorge.org/) at [Scatter](http://scatter.nyc) gave the talk that probably inspired me to start all this. I saw him at Resonate but [the Eyeo talk is the same](https://vimeo.com/134973504). 

*	[Golan Levin](http://www.flong.com) ran the [Experimental Capture](http://golancourses.net/capture2016/) workshop I attended in 2016. He directs the [Studio for Creative Enquiry](http://studioforcreativeinquiry.org) at CMU. 

*	[The Centre for the Study of the Networked Image](http://www.centreforthestudyof.net) at London South Bank University seems to be exploring a lot of areas I'm interested in and has a collaboration with [The Photographer's Gallery](http://thephotographersgallery.org.uk). 


##Galleries and Festival I'll be approaching

Again, I'm open to suggestions.

*	[The Photographer's Gallery](http://thephotographersgallery.org.uk), London
* Open Eye, Liverpool
* Abandon Normal Devices
